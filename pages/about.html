    <h2 class="glow">Why choose Sam?</h2>
    <p>After achieving a First Class Honours degree in Computing, hard work, a rigorous interview process (and a
      sprinkle of luck), Sam was awarded a BCS scholarship from the Academy of Computing to train at the prestigious
      King's College London, where he qualified with a PGCE in Computer Science.
      Following this, Sam taught Computing in the TES Secondary School of the Year - St.Thomas the Apostle College.</p>

    <h2 class="glow">Teaching style and tutoring excellence</h2>
    <p>Sam follows an evolving pedagogy of demonstrate/model, task, review which often changes depending on the subject
      and the way that students learn. Sam is able to combine his diverse teaching experience (students aged from 5-18)
      with an extensive background in Computing, Web Development and Programming as well as 8 years working within the
      Systems Support Industry to inform and teach his students with excellent results.</p>

    <h2 class="glow">School Experience</h2>
    <p>As a qualified Teacher of Computer Science teacher, Sam has taught across London in both all-boys and all-girls
      schools (pupils aged 11 - 18) whilst spending some time in mixed secondary and primary schools. This has allowed
      Sam to teach and relate to a wide range of students, and subsequently Sam has become a very sought-after teacher
      and tutor! Prior to full-time tutoring Sam work in the TES School of the Year, where he helping students develop
      academically and personally as they moved into adulthood.</p>

    <h2 class="glow">Favourite part of tutoring</h2>
    <p>Sam’s favourite part of his job as a teacher is two-pronged: getting to know his students and then using this
      knowledge to help develop their skills. There is no better way to do this than through one-to-one tutoring in a
      relaxed and comfortable setting, as he is then able to focus all attention on their learning. This enables the
      fastest learning curve and ensures the most enjoyment for the student.</p>

    <h2 class="glow">Other interests</h2>
    <p>Maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle is crucial. Exercising via football, yoga, the gym and plenty of
      walking, as well as keeping the mind sharp by implementing emerging practices in both personal programming work,
      and many of my students' projects.</p>
