        <div class="item review-text">Sam‚Äôs Computer subject knowledge and programming skills are excellent. Having worked with Sam
          as HOD at an outstanding school I feel that Sam was always professional and passionate to bring a positive
          vibe to learning. He has numerous resources to engage all abilities in a range of programming and theory
          topics. Highly recommended. </div>

        <div class="item review-text">I've about ten hours of lessons with Sam now. I'm very happy - he's very helpful and knows
          how to explain the concepts very well. He is particularly good at the programming side and it seems it is his
          favorite part to teach. Sam is very thorough and makes sure you understand the concepts well. It makes a big
          difference to have a qualified teacher! I will continue to have regular lessons with him and would definitely
          recommend him. </div>
